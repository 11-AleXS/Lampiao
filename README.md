## ⬇️ Install and Run
With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed, clone the git repo and install dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/alessfm/Lampiao.git
cd Lampiao
npm i
```

You can then run following scripts for local development:

```
npm start  // local demo, watches and rebuilds on changes
```
```
npm test  // test your changes
```
```
npm run watch  // make a new build folder
```

**Note:** If Lampiao doesn't hot reload or reflect changes during `npm start`, then do `npm run watch` and then `npm start`. It's a common bug with electron-reload.
